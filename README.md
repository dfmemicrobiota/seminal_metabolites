Several studies have found associations between specific bacterial genera and semen parameters. Bacteria are known to influence the composition of their niche and, consequently, could affect the composition of the seminal plasma. This study integrated microbiota profiling and metabolomics to explore the influence of seminal bacteria on semen metabolite composition in infertile couples, revealing associations between specific bacterial genera and metabolite profiles. Amino acids and acylcarnitines were the predominant metabolite groups identified in seminal plasma. Different microbiota profiles did not result to globally diverse metabolite compositions in seminal plasma. Nevertheless, levels of specific metabolites increased in the presence of a dysbiotic microbiota. Urocanate was significantly increased in abnormal semen samples (adjusted p-value < 0.001) and enriched in samples dominated by Prevotella spp. (p-value < 0.05), which was previously linked to a negative impact on semen. Therefore, varying microbiota profiles can influence the abundance of certain metabolites, potentially having an immunomodulatory effect, as seen with urocanate.![image](https://github.com/dfmemicrobiota/seminal_metabolites/assets/75491874/c64d61d4-5ef2-498e-878e-7a288b46cd9a)
